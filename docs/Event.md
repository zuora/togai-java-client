## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**schemaName** | **String** | Name of the Event Schema.  Know more about [event schema](https://docs.togai.com/docs/event-schemas)  |  |
|**id** | **String** | A unique value to identify the event instance. This unique value should be generated by the client and it acts as the **idempotency key**. Togai server will use this key to recognize subsequent retries of the same request and avoid metering multiple times for that same request. This id can be created in any format but we recommend using UUIDv4 to reduce collision occurance.    NOTE1: Expiry time for idempotency validation will be until the end of the billing cycle. Any request which comes after the billing cycle with the same id will be treated as new request and ingested for metering.   NOTE2: If the billing cycle is not configured for the idempotency validation will be until **10 days** of the event ingestion. |  |
